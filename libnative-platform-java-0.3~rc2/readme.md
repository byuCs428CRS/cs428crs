
# Native-platform: Java bindings for various native APIs

A collection of cross-platform Java APIs for various native APIs. Supports OS X, Linux, Solaris and Windows.

These APIs support Java 5 and later. Some of these APIs overlap with APIs available in later Java versions.

## Available bindings

### System information

* Get kernel name and version.
* Get machine architecture.

### Processes

* Get the PID of the current process.
* Get and set the process working directory.
* Get and set the process environment variables.

### Terminal and console

These bindings work for both the UNIX terminal and the Windows console:

* Determine if stdout/stderr are attached to a terminal.
* Query the terminal size.
* Switch between bold and normal mode on the terminal.
* Change foreground color on the terminal.
* Move terminal cursor up, down, left, right, start of line.
* Clear to end of line.

### File systems

* Get and set UNIX file mode.
* Create and read symbolic links.
* List the available file systems on the machine
* Query file system mount point.
* Query file system type.
* Query file system device name.
* Query whether a file system is local or remote.

## Supported platforms

Currently ported to OS X, Linux and Windows. Support for Solaris and FreeBSD is a work in progress. Tested on:

* OS X 10.7.4, 10.8 (x86_64), 10.6.7 (i386)
* Ubunutu 12.04 (amd64), 8.04.4 (i386, amd64)
* Windows 7 (x64), XP (x86)
* Solaris 11 (x86)

## Using

Include `native-platform.jar` and `native-platform-${os}-${arch}.jar` in your classpath. From Gradle, you can do
this:

    repositories {
        maven { url "http://repo.gradle.org/gradle/libs-releases-local" }
    }

    dependencies {
        compile "net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform:0.3"
    }

You can also download [here](http://repo.gradle.org/gradle/libs-releases-local/net/rubygrapefruit/)

Some sample code to use the terminal:

    import net.rubygrapefruit.platform.Native;
    import net.rubygrapefruit.platform.Terminals;
    import net.rubygrapefruit.platform.Terminal;
    import static net.rubygrapefruit.platform.Terminals.Output.*;

    Terminals terminals = Native.get(Terminals.class);

    // check if terminal
    terminals.isTerminal(Stdout);

    // use terminal
    Terminal stdout = terminals.getTerminal(Stdout);
    stdout.bold();
    System.out.println("bold text");

## Changes

* Get and set process environment variables.
* Launch processes.
* Fixed character set issue on Linux and Mac OS X.
* Fixes to work with 64-bit OpenJDK 7 on Mac OS X. Thanks to Rene Grï¿½schke.

### 0.2

* Fixes to make native library extraction multi-process safe.
* Fixes to windows terminal detection and reset.

### 0.1

* Initial release.

# Development

## Building

You will need to use the Gradle wrapper. Just run `gradlew` in the root directory.

### Ubuntu

The g++ compiler is required to build the native library. You will need the `g++` package for this. Usually this is already installed.

You need to install the `libncurses5-dev` package to pick up the ncurses header files. Also worth installing the `ncurses-doc` package too.

#### 64-bit machines with multi-arch support

Where multi-arch support is available (e.g. recent Ubuntu releases), you can build the i386 and amd64 versions of the library on the
same machine.

You need to install the `gcc-multilib` and `g++-multilib` packages to pick up i386 support.

You need to install the `lib32ncurses5-dev` package to pick up the ncurses i386 version.

To build, include `-Pmultiarch` on the command-line.

### Windows

You need to install Visual studio, and build from a Visual studio command prompt.

### OS X

The g++ compiler is required to build the native library. You will need to install the XCode tools for this.

### Solaris

For Solaris 11, you need to install the `development/gcc-45` and `system/header` packages.

## Running

Run `gradle installApp` to install the test application into `test-app/build/install/native-platform-test`. Or
`gradle distZip` to create an application distribtion in `test-app/build/distributions/native-platform-test-$version.zip`.

You can run `$INSTALL_DIR/bin/native-platform-test` to run the test application.

# Releasing

    * OS X universal
    * Linux i386, using Ubunutu 8.04
    * Linux amd64, using Ubunutu 8.04

## Testing

* Test on IBM JVM.
* Test on Java 5, 6, 7.

## TODO

### Fixes

* Posix: allow terminal to be detected when ncurses cannot be loaded
* Windows: fix detection of shared drive under VMWare fusion and Windows XP
* Windows: restore std handles after launching child process
* Linux: detect remote filesystems.
* Solaris: fix unicode file name handling.
* Solaris: fail for unsupported architecture.
* Solaris: build 32 bit and 64 bit libraries.
* Freebsd: finish port.
* Freebsd: fail for unsupported architecture.
* Freebsd: build 32 bit and 64 bit libraries.

### Improvements

* Use wchar_to_java() for windows system and file system info.
* Test network file systems on Mac, Linux, Windows
* Test mount points on Windows
* Cache class, method and field lookups
* Change readLink() implementation so that it does not need to NULL terminate the encoded content
* Don't use NewStringUTF() anywhere
* Use iconv() to convert from C char string to UTF-16 when converting from C char string to Java String.
* Support for cygwin terminal
* Use TERM=xtermc instead of TERM=xterm on Solaris.
* Add diagnostics for terminal.
* Version each native interface separately.
* String names for errno values.
* Split into multiple projects.
* Convert to c.
* Use fully decomposed form for unicode file names on hfs+ filesystems.
* Extend FileSystem to deal with removable media.
* Add a method to Terminal that returns a PrintStream that can be used to write to the terminal, regardless of what
  System.out/System.err point to.
* Add a Terminal implementation that uses ANSI control codes. Use this on UNIX platforms when TERM != 'dumb' and
  libncurses cannot be loaded.
* Add a method to Terminal that indicates whether the cursor wraps to the next line when a character is written to the
  rightmost character position.
* Check for null parameters.

### Ideas

* Expose platform-specific HTTP proxy configuration. Query registry on windows to determine IE settings.
* Expose native named semaphores, mutexes and condition variables (CreateMutex, CreateSemaphore, CreateEvent, semget, sem_open, etc).
* Expose information about network interfaces.
* Fire events when filesystems or network interfaces change in some way.
* Fire events when terminal size changes.
* Fire events when files change.
* Expose system keystores and authentication services.
* Expose a mechanism for generating a temporary directory.

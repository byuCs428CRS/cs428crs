Hello Team!
Greeting from Nick Humrich

I have set up the very basic framework for the back-end stuff.

To get started, here are some things you need to do:
Dont worry, its only 3 steps!

#############################
##First: If your reading this from github, go ahead pull down the code.
#############################
    cd to the directory where you want to store the root of your project
git clone https://github.com/byuCs428CRS/cs428crs.git

    Now you can open this project in any IDE you want.
    I used IntelliJ. With intelliJ you can simply do File > Open.. then select the build.gradle file
    it should pull in the whole project.
    If your using eclipse you can go: File>Import>Gradle (If this is not an option,
    install the gradle integration from marketplace via help). Follow the instructions after this. 
	

#############################
##Step 2: Install Gradle
#############################
    if you are on linux you can add the ppa for it

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cwchien/gradle
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gradle
gradle -v

    If the last command prints out the gradle version (should be 1.10) then you are good to go.
    If you are on Mac or Windows, you can install gradle the manual way, using a zip file
    http://www.gradle.org/downloads

    always make sure you can do
gradle -v

    this will verify installation.

    If you are using windows, add the path to the bin folder to your environmental variables.
    Also make sure you have a system variable called JAVA_HOME set to the jre or jdk folder. 


#############################
##Step 3: Start up the server!
#############################
    make sure you are in the directory for the project. if you havent moved you should be able to cd into it:
cd cs428crs
    Once your in the right directory, run the following command
./gradlew clean build && java -jar build/libs/gs-rest-service-0.1.0.jar

    The command for windows is: gradle clean build && java -jar build/libs/gs-rest-service-0.1.0.jar
    You should see some text say "Spring" like this:

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL

    Total time: 22.429 secs

      .   ____          _            __ _ _
     /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \
    ( ( )\___ | '_ | '_| | '_ \/ _` | \ \ \ \
     \\/  ___)| |_)| | | | | || (_| |  ) ) ) )
      '  |____| .__|_| |_|_| |_\__, | / / / /
     =========|_|==============|___/=/_/_/_/
     :: Spring Boot ::             (v0.5.0.M6)



    If you have that then you are good to go!!!
    You can now connect to your local server at localhost:8080

    to test it out try localhost:8080/greeting
    also try http://localhost:8080/greeting/v2/test

    Look at the 4 classes currently in the hello folder and it should make sense what is happening. If not, feel free to read about it.
    Below is the tutorial I used to set it up, it has further information in case you are interested.
